The Active Recall tool facilitates reading comprehension through chatbot-driven question generation and dynamic answer checking. It is meant to help those who, like me, have a pesky habit of mind-wandering when attempting to absorb large chunks of text, leading to an ever-present "wait, what did I just read"?
Developed with Django. Chatbot via Groq and Langchain.
